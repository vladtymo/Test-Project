    <h3>Version Control System</h3>
    <p>
        Git is a distributed version control system: tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating
        work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include
        speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
