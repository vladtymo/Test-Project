    <h1>remote - the command Git</h1>

    </p>
    <p>
        The git remote command allows you to create, view, and delete connections to other repositories. 
        Remote connections are more like bookmarks than direct links to other repositories. They are convenient names 
        to refer to a not-so-convenient URL, rather than providing real-time access to another repository.
