    <title>1.Merging is used in Git to bring together a branched history.
         The git merge command merges separate development projects created 
         with the git branch command into a single branch
        2.Please note: all the commands below perform a merge into the current branch,
         while the target branch remains unchanged. Therefore,
          the git merge command is often used in conjunction with the git checkout
           (to select the current branch) and git branch -d (to remove the obsolete target branch)
            commands.
